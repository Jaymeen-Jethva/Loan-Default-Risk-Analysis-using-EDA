# Credit Risk Analysis - Exploratory Data Analysis
### Project Overview
- This project involves conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on loan application data for a consumer finance company. The goal is to identify patterns and factors that indicate whether a client is likely to have difficulty paying their loan installments. This analysis will help the company make informed decisions about loan approvals and mitigate financial risks.

### Business Understanding
- The company specializes in lending various types of loans to urban customers. They face challenges in assessing loan applications for individuals with insufficient or non-existent credit history. The analysis aims to ensure that applicants capable of repaying loans are not rejected while also minimizing the risk of approving loans for potential defaulters.

### Objectives
1. Identify patterns and driving factors that indicate if a client may have difficulty paying loan installments.
2. Understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency to default.
3. Provide insights that can be used for:
- Denying high-risk loan applications
- Adjusting loan amounts
- Setting appropriate interest rates for risky applicants
### Data Description
The dataset contains information about loan applications, including:

- Client demographics
- Loan attributes
- Payment history
It includes two types of scenarios:

1. Clients with payment difficulties (late payments)
2. Clients with on-time payments
### Methodology
The project utilizes Exploratory Data Analysis techniques to:

1. Clean and preprocess the data
2. Perform univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis
3. Visualize patterns and relationships in the data
4. Identify key factors influencing loan default risk
### Expected Outcomes
- Identification of strong indicators of loan default
- Insights into customer segments with higher default risk
- Recommendations for improving the loan approval process
- Visualization of key findings and patterns
### Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
